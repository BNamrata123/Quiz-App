# Space Quiz App

## Description

This project is an interactive web-based quiz game themed around space facts and astronomy. It combines an engaging quiz experience with a visually appealing animated starry night background.

## Key Features

### Starry Background Animation
The background is a full-screen canvas with twinkling stars that gently fade in and out to simulate a realistic night sky. The stars continuously animate, creating a calming and immersive outer space atmosphere.

### Space Quiz
Users answer multiple-choice questions about space, planets, and astronomy. Each question has four options, and players select their answer by clicking a button.

### Countdown Timer
Each question has a 15-second timer displayed at the top, adding a time challenge to the quiz. If the timer runs out, the quiz automatically moves to the next question.

### Immediate Feedback and Scoring
When a user selects the correct answer, a random interesting space fact pops up in a visually distinct fact card, enhancing learning while keeping the game fun. The user's score is updated accordingly.

### Result Display
At the end of the quiz, the final score is shown, indicating how many questions the user answered correctly out of the total.

### Responsive and Interactive
The quiz interface dynamically updates with each question, disables answers once selected to prevent multiple clicks, and clearly highlights correct and incorrect choices for better clarity.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the basic webpage structure and styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: To handle quiz logic, timer, starry background animation, and user interactions.
- **Canvas API**: For creating and animating the starry background effect.
